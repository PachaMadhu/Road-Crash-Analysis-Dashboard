🚦 Traffic Crash Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze traffic crash incidents and uncover patterns related to time, location, road conditions, environmental factors, and driver behavior.
The goal is to transform raw crash data into actionable insights that can support road safety analysis and decision-making.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed crash records with attributes such as:

Crash date and time
Location and municipality
Road and lane characteristics
Weather, light, and surface conditions
Collision type and harmful events
At-fault and hit-and-run indicators
The data was cleaned and modeled to enable accurate aggregations and interactive analysis.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze crash trends over time
Identify key factors contributing to crashes
Evaluate the impact of road, environmental, and lighting conditions
Detect high-risk locations and crash hotspots

Compare driver behavior factors such as at-fault and hit-and-run cases

Enable interactive exploration through filters and drill-downs
